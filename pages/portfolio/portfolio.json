A very tiny script that toggles an MQTT device that toggles my LaptopCharger based on how necessary it is. Why did I make this? - time for story time with Sanjit(I hope you realize that I am not boasting about a simple thingie, but I dont have an image lol and I really need to fill this space). For a computer person, I have not taken much good care of my computer. At some point in time, my battery started lasting 1 hour, then 30 mins, and then school was going back in person so I needed a laptop that would not die, and got the battery replaced. I realized that my laptop was old enough to take care of itself, so I gave it a set of instructions: telling it to charge my laptop when there is not enough charge and stop charging it when its enough.",
