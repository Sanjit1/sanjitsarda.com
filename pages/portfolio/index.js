                Hi. If you want to look at some of the work on things Here are
                some of the things I have worked on and stuff. I do not like
                featuring small projects, so you will find <em>some</em> of them
                here: If I showcase a tiny project here, it is probably because
                I use it a ton or I find it significant for some other reason.
                You might find <em>some</em> of my other projects on my{" "}
                <Link href="https://github.com/Sanjit1">
                    <a>GitHub</a>
                </Link>
                , but I keep most of my personal projects private. I don't have
                everything on there, so if you want to know about some of my
                projects, feel free to email me!
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is something I will try, a sorting system.(sike! later,
                scater)

                    Why did I make this? - time for story time with Sanjit(I hope you realize that I am not boasting about
                    a simple thingie, but I dont have an image lol and I really need to fill this space). 
                    For a computer person, I have not taken much good care of my computer. At some point 
                    in time, my battery started lasting 1 hour, then 30 mins, and then school was going back in person
                    so I needed a laptop that would not die, and got the battery replaced. I realized that my laptop was old enough
                    to take care of itself, so I gave it a set of instructions: telling it to charge my laptop when there is not enough charge
                    and stop charging it when its enough."
