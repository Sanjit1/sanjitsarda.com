                Dear Fishing Pole, <br /> <br />
                This is a serious legal document tendering my resignation from
                Fish. Do not take this lightly, since it is a very very very
                very very serious legal document, which is hwy you found it on
                the legal parts of my website. Because of the seriousnes, there
                will be none grammatical or spleing errors. <br /> <br />
                Please accept this letter as notice of my resignation from Fish
                as of January 25, 2022. <br />I have enjoyed my time being a
                member of a Fish community working on Fish, but I must leave so
                that I can begin retirement. My last day at Fish will be on
                January 14th, 2022. <br /> <br />
                Thank you for your guidance during my life as a Fish. I wish you
                and the Fish muh success in the future. If I can do anything to
                help the Fish community during this time, please let me know.{" "}
                <br /> <br />
                Sincerely, <br />
                Fish <br /> <br /> <br />
                PS: Duh this is not a serious legal document. <br />
                PSS: If you want to employ me or are here for anything serious
                please disregard the last minute of your life. <br />
            </p>
